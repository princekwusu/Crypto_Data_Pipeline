# Binance Data Pipeline

This project is a data pipeline for fetching trade data from Binance API, persisting it in an S3 bucket, and loading it into Redshift and RDS databases. 

### Description of Kline Data
Kline data, also known as candlestick data, provides a summarized view of trading activity for a specific trading pair within a given time frame. Each data point, represented by a candlestick, includes information about the opening price, closing price, highest price, lowest price, and trading volume during that period.

#### Contents of Kline Data
The Kline data includes the following fields:










## Overview

The pipeline consists of the following steps:

1. Fetch data from the Binance API.
2. Persist the data in a compressed format (JSON) in an S3 bucket.
3. Load the data from S3 into Redshift.
4. Load the data from S3 into an RDS database.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- AWS account with appropriate permissions to access S3, Redshift, and RDS.
- Boto3 library for AWS interaction.
- Psycopg2 library for PostgreSQL database interaction.

### Pros and Cons of the Binance Data Pipeline

#### Pros:

1. **Scalability**: The pipeline is designed to handle large volumes of data efficiently, making it suitable for scaling as your data needs grow.
   
2. **Flexibility**: Users can easily customize the pipeline according to their specific requirements by adjusting configurations and modifying the main script.

3. **Reliability**: By persisting data in S3 before loading it into databases, the pipeline ensures data integrity and provides a backup in case of failures during database loading.

4. **Ease of Deployment**: With clear setup instructions and minimal dependencies, deploying the pipeline on different environments is straightforward.

5. **Comprehensive Data Handling**: The pipeline fetches data from Binance API, stores it in S3, and loads it into both Redshift and RDS databases, covering a wide range of data storage and processing needs.

#### Cons:

1. **Complexity**: Setting up the pipeline requires configuring AWS services, managing dependencies, and understanding the flow of data between different components, which may be complex for users unfamiliar with AWS or data pipelines.

2. **Cost**: Running the pipeline involves costs associated with AWS services such as S3 storage, Redshift, and RDS, which can accumulate depending on the volume of data and usage patterns.

3. **Maintenance Overhead**: Regular maintenance is required to ensure the pipeline runs smoothly, including monitoring for errors, updating dependencies, and optimizing performance.

4. **Limited Error Handling**: While the pipeline performs basic error handling, it may not handle all possible failure scenarios, requiring additional implementation for robust error management.

5. **Potential Security Risks**: Improperly configured AWS credentials or inadequate security measures could lead to unauthorized access or data breaches, emphasizing the importance of security best practices.

By considering these pros and cons, users can make informed decisions about whether this pipeline meets their specific data processing needs and fits within their operational constraints.


## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/binance-data-pipeline.git
```

2. Install the required Python packages.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Configure your AWS credentials. You can set them up using the AWS CLI or through environment variables.

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
```

## Usage

1. Run the main Python script to execute the data pipeline.

```bash
python main.py
```

This script will fetch the latest trade data from Binance, persist it in S3, and load it into Redshift and RDS databases.

## Configuration

- `main.py`: Main script to execute the data pipeline.
- `config.py`: Configuration file containing AWS credentials, endpoint URLs, and database credentials.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies.

## Customization

- Adjust the Binance API endpoint, S3 bucket name, Redshift parameters, and RDS parameters in the `config.py` file according to your setup.
- Modify the main script (`main.py`) if you need to change the data processing logic or add additional steps to the pipeline.
